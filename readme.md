# Semi-Supervised JT-VAE for Molecular Graphs

**Nov 2022**: Our paper is accepted to [AAAI 23' Deep Learning on Graphs workshop](https://deep-learning-graphs.bitbucket.io/dlg-aaai23/index.html)!

## Usage
### Quickstart
Run `semi_jtvae_train.ipynb` for training a model and run `semi_jtvae_gen.ipynb` for (conditionally) generating molecules using the trained model.
